A Repo for the project me and friends did for the internship at STARC-PESU.  
 Machine Learning and Data Analytics
The project aims to estimate the final scores for upcoming matches and calculate the probabilities of
various outcomes, such as team wins,intermediate over score and final scores for both the innings. By leveraging this data-driven
analysis, the project enhances decision-making for cricket enthusiasts, fans, team strategists, and
bookmakers, providing insights and predictions based on historical patterns and relevant variables

Cricket fans worldwide eagerly follow the Indian Premier League (IPL), a prestigious Twenty20
cricket tournament held annually in India. With its high intensity and star-studded lineups,
predicting the score of IPL matches becomes a captivating endeavor.
Accurate score predictions in IPL matches have immense value for teams, analysts, and fans.
While traditional methods relied on subjective judgments, the advent of machine learning
and data analysis has opened new avenues for developing data-driven models that can
leverage historical IPL match data.
By incorporating factors such as the batting team, bowling team, current score, overs played,
and other relevant variables, machine learning algorithms can discern patterns and
relationships crucial for predicting the final score. This predictive capability can aid teams in
strategic decision-making, enable analysts to assess player performance, and enhance the
overall engagement and excitement of the IPL fans.
